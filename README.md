# kaiui-vue

> KaiOS UI Component for Vue (developing, need help)

The project is porting code from [AdrianMachado/KaiUI](https://github.com/AdrianMachado/KaiUI).

**The project is developing so slow, please do not use it for production purposes until the code has been ported. But you can still contribute code to this project to make it complete.**

## Build Setup

``` bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## TODO List

- [ ] Porting code completed (React to Vue).

- [ ] Switch SASS/SCSS to LESS or change SASS package.(I don't like `node-sass` package)
