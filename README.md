# kaiui-vue

> KaiOS UI Component for Vue (developing, need help)

The project is porting code from [AdrianMachado/KaiUI](https://github.com/AdrianMachado/KaiUI)

## Build Setup

``` bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## TODO List

- [ ] Porting code completed (React to Vue).

- [ ] Switch SASS/SCSS to LESS or change SASS package.(I don't like `node-sass` package)
